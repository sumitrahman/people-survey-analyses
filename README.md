# people-survey-analyses
# Where I am keeping code (Stata and R) that I have used for analysing People Survey and Pulse Survey microdata.
# This code acts on microdata.  In the case of People Survey it relies on some extra poststratification input from me that is stored as a spreadsheet.  But the code should be straightforward to pick up and adapt.
# Actually the extra spreadsheet inputs are fields for directorate, group and organisation for each individual (based on their reporting unit), poststratum (which was based on group and grade between 2012 and 2014, but in 2015 we just used grade) and postweights.
#In 2015 the analysis was done by my colleague KP, who adapted my code from earlier years.  There are some instances of code that has been copied over but not actually used in 2015.
