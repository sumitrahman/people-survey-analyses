# people-survey-analyses
# Where I am keeping code (Stata and R) that I have used for analysing People Survey and Pulse Survey microdata.
# This code acts on microdata.  In the case of People Survey it relies on some extra poststratification input from me that is stored as a spreadsheet.  But the code should be straightforward to pick up and adapt.
# Actually the extra spreadsheet inputs are fields for directorate, group and organisation for each individual (based on their reporting unit), poststratum (which is currently based on group and grade, but I think I may simplify this to grade) and postweights.
